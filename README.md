# ASA_code
A custom simulation for forensic spatial analysis, designed to determine the physical avoidability of a right-turn vehicle-pedestrian collision based on geometric constraints and probabilistic human factors. This project extends geosimulation principles into a high-fidelity, short-temporal-window investigative pipeline.
